They imagined a company that would provide financial services to clients as well as technology services to other financial firms. The result of their vision is Aladdin, our industry leading, end-to-end investment management platform. Data is at the heart of Aladdin and of everything we do. Since inception, data has remained at the core of BlackRock's operations. Today, we manage data at the highest end of the scale utilizing a framework that spans\u202f<strong>vendor management</strong>, <strong>data governance, model governance, quality control</strong>, and <strong>entitlements</strong>. While our business grows, so does the volume of data we process;\u202ftherefore,\u202fwe are constantly innovating and improving our processes.\u202f&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Team Overview:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Data is at the core of the Aladdin platform, and increasingly, our ability to consume, store, analyze, and gain insight from data is a key component of our competitive advantage. <strong>Aladdin Data </strong>is responsible for enterprise data and analytics for BlackRock and its Aladdin clients.\u202fWe also develop and operate the platforms that produce, distribute, and <strong>govern enterprise data </strong>and analytics. Our goal is a largely automated, <strong>cloud-native platform </strong>that radically transforms our data and analytics supply chain, making it<strong> faster</strong>,<strong> easier</strong>,<strong> </strong>and <strong>cheaper</strong> to <strong>discover</strong>, <strong>access</strong>, and <strong>leverage data</strong> and <strong>analytics</strong> for asset management. We engineer high performance data pipelines, provide a fabric to discover and consume data, and continually evolve our data storage capabilities. We believe in writing small, testable code with a focus on innovation. We are committed to open source, and we regularly contribute our work back to the community.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We are seeking top tier Cloud Native DevOps Platform Engineers to augment our Enterprise Data Platform team, Aladdin Studio, and Data Engineering.
